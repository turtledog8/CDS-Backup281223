ArrayLists:
#### Selection Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space.
Efficiency: Selection sort in ArrayLists involves swapping elements based on their indexes. The time complexity remains O(n^2), regardless of the data structure. However, the direct access to elements by index allows for efficient swaps, maintaining the expected time complexity.
Speed Consideration: While the time complexity remains the same, ArrayLists might execute selection sort relatively faster compared to other data structures due to efficient random access.

#### Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(n) - linear space for temporary arrays during merging.
Efficiency: Merge sort divides the ArrayList into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together. The direct access to elements allows for efficient splitting and merging, maintaining the expected time complexity.
Speed Consideration: Although the time complexity remains consistent, merge sort in ArrayLists might perform faster due to efficient memory allocation and access patterns.

Linked Lists:
#### Selection Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space.
Efficiency: Selection sort in a Linked List involves traversing the list to find the minimum element, leading to increased time complexity. While the Big-O complexity doesn't change, the actual traversal impacts the algorithm's speed.
Speed Consideration: The traversal required for selection sort in a Linked List may significantly slow down the sorting process compared to ArrayLists due to indirect element access.

#### Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(log n) - due to recursive calls.
Efficiency: Merge sort, due to its divide-and-conquer approach, can efficiently merge sorted sublists within a Linked List. While the Big-O time complexity remains the same, the efficiency in merging already sorted parts of the list can improve the speed.
Speed Consideration: Merge sort might be more efficient in Linked Lists compared to selection sort due to its inherent nature of merging sorted sublists without direct access to elements.

Queues:
#### Selection Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space.
Efficiency: Selection sort on Queues involves dequeuing and enqueuing elements, impacting the time complexity slightly due to frequent manipulations. Although the Big-O complexity remains the same, the additional enqueue and dequeue operations might slow down the sorting process.
Speed Consideration: Enqueueing and dequeuing elements in a Queue during selection sort might make it slower compared to ArrayLists or Linked Lists.

#### Merge Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
Space Complexity: O(n) - linear space for temporary storage.
Efficiency: Merge sort on Queues requires dequeuing and merging, which might not be as efficient due to the structure of a Queue. While the Big-O time complexity remains unchanged, the need for frequent dequeuing and enqueuing operations could impact the speed negatively.
Speed Consideration: Similar to selection sort, merge sort in Queues might face inefficiency due to dequeuing and enqueuing operations, potentially slowing down the sorting process.
